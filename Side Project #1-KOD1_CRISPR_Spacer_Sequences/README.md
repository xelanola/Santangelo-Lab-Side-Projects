#Santangelo Lab Side Projects #1 - KOD1 CRISPR SPACERS
The Santangelo lab has a file containing the entire 2Mbp genome sequence for the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis (Tko). ~40% of bacteria and ~90% of archaea encode CRISPR elements. The goals of the side project were to identify all CRISPR spacer sequences in the KOD1 genome with the intention of determining the homology of spacer sequences to the viruses the host cell defence systems are encoded against.

This repository contains the KOD1 genome sequence, the code used to locate all the spacer sequences, and the output csv file.
