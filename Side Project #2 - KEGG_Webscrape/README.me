#Side Project #2 - KEGG_Webscrape

The purpose of this project was to develop a script that can pull information on every gene in Thermococcus kodakarensis from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.

I used the BeautifulSoup package to web scrape information on gene number, annotated function nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence, and KO terms for all 2306 genes. 
I generated an output csv file that contains all the genes, as well as a calculation of the molecular weight of one monomer in Kda.
